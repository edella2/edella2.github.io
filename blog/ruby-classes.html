      <p> When you first get a puppy you get to do one of the most exciting things with it right away.  You can name it!</p>
      <code class="container">class Puppy</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(name)</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@name = name</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;end</code>
      <code class="container">end</code>

      <p> But having a puppy that just has a name isn't exciting.  Things that make puppies so much fun is seeing them wag their tail when you say their name! </p>

      <code class="container">class Puppy</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(name)</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@name = name</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;end</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;def wag</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "#{@name} is such a good dog!"</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "*#{@name} wags their tail*"</code>
      <code class="container">&nbsp;&nbsp;end</code>
      <code class="container">end</code>

      <p> The above is an example of why you often want to use instance variables instead of local variables in classes. Because our <code>@name</code>  is an instance variable <code>@name</code> can be used with any method inside of the puppy class.  Instance variables should be used where it make sense, the puppy's name will always be the same throughout the class and may need to be reused for other methods or tricks we want to teach our puppy. </p>

<!-- - Classes in ruby is a lot like training a puppy to do a new trick




Internet login security has been a concern since the beginning. So much of our lives are stored online and the only thing protecting them is our username and some simple password. The solution people recommend is to create a very complex password, many characters long that only you know.  However, many people don't want to be bothered remembering a password 16 characters long, with 3 capitol letters, numbers and characters.  They will often opt to create a shorter simpler password that is more susceptible to being stolen or hacked.

Solutions to this have been the use of two factor authentication or things like hardware tokens.  A hardware token is something you can plug into a USB port that generates a one-time password.  This is a safe and secure option, but is still maybe not the most reasonable as there is no reason to have it with you at all times.

The option I am in favor of is using two factor authentication through our smart phones.  In the present day nearly everyone has a smartphone with them at all times.  Google offers a free authenticator application, which I use and have found the set up to be easy.  I think as web designers when we start creating sites that require log ins, we should consider implementing two factor authentication as an option for people to use.  It is important to protect users and ourselves from any threats. -->
