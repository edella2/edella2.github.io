      <h3 class="fz-xxl">Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript: Objects</h3>
      <h4 class="fz-l">Round 1 - FIGHT!</h4>
      <h5>10/25/2015</h5>


      <p> Hearing "hashes" when using Ruby used to send shivers up my spine.  I was horrible with them, they were confusing to me and I just never seemed to be able to use them.  I never thought I would have to deal with something I thought was so complicated and confusing again until this week when I met... JavaScript: Objects.  </p>

      <span class= "container center"><img class="et--portrait" src="../imgs/round-1-fight.jpeg" alt="round-1-fight! img"></span>

      <p> If you read my other blog about arrays vs hashes a few weeks ago, you would see that despite having trouble learning to use hashes I had to concede that they were super useful. </p>

      <p> To define a hash in ruby we would type something like the following: </p>

      <code class="container"> eric = { </code>
        <code class="container">  name: "Eric",</code>
        <code class="container">  age: 28,          </code>
        <code class="container">  job: "Student" </code>
        <code class="container">  home: "SF, CA"    </code>
        <code class="container">  } </code>

      <p> To define a object in JavaScript we would have to type: </p>

      <code class="container"> var eric = { </code>
        <code class="container">  name: "Eric",</code>
        <code class="container">  age: 28,          </code>
        <code class="container">  job: "Student" </code>
        <code class="container">  home: "SF, CA"    </code>
        <code class="container">  } </code>

        <p> ... Wait that's pretty much the same thing. The differences between JavaScript and Ruby lie between how the keys and key values are stored.  In ruby the key ( i.e. name, age) can be anything from strings, integers or symbols.  While in JavaScript the keys have to be strings.</p>

        <p> But don't rule JavaScript out yet for only storing key values as strings.  It has a few other cool things you might not know about. Objects and their key values can be accessed using dot notation.  If I wanted to access my age in JavaScript I could type:</p>

        <code class="container">  eric.name </code>

        <p> or </p>

        <code class="container">  eric["name"] </code>

        <p>Having multiple ways to access information stored in an object is a great thing for flexibility (and readability!) </p>

        <p> Other differences between the two exist with how we can interact with the information stored in a hash or object. </p>

        <p> Ruby has several built in class methods and enumerables, such as <code>hash_name.each</code> that interact with hashes that makes iterating through a hash a breeze. </p>

        <p> These same enumerables do not exist with JavaScript because Objects also work in a similar fashion as classes in Ruby.  Objects in JavaScript can store methods as well inside the hash!(a further in depth explanation on that subject for round 2) </p>
