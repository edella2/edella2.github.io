      <h3 class="fz-xxl">Online login security</h3>
      <h4 class="fz-l">Using two factor authentication</h4>
      <h5>10/03/2015</h5>

      <p>Internet login security has been a concern since the beginning. So much of our lives are stored online and the only thing protecting them is our username and some simple password. The solution people recommend is to create a very complex password, many characters long that only you know.  However, many people don't want to be bothered remembering a password 16 characters long, with 3 capitol letters, numbers and characters.  They will often opt to create a shorter simpler password that is more susceptible to being stolen or hacked.</p>


      <p> Solutions to this have been the use of two factor authentication or things like hardware tokens.  A hardware token is something you can plug into a USB port that generates a one-time password.  This is a safe and secure option, but is still maybe not the most reasonable as there is no reason to have it with you at all times.</p>

      <p>The option I am in favor of is using two factor authentication through our smart phones.  In the present day nearly everyone has a smartphone with them at all times.  Google offers a free authenticator application, which I use and have found the set up to be easy.  I think as web designers when we start creating sites that require log ins, we should consider implementing two factor authentication as an option for people to use.  It is important to protect users and ourselves from any threats.</p>

<!-- - passwords are getting simple because nobody wants to remember a lot of complex log ins
- this is bad because people can steal this info more easily
- option 1 is a thing like a YubiKey
- options to solve it could be 2FA
- lastpass, fingerprints, voice, eyes

- why 2fa is the best
- things we still need to be aware of with 2fa
