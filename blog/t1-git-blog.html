    <h3>
      What are the benefits of version control?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Version control allows you to track and manage changes made to a file.  Version control is extremely beneficial for working on a project with a large group.  It helps protect the master branch and provides a form of back up if it is needed to revert to an earlier version.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How does git help you keep track of changes?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Git is a form of version control.  By allowing people to work on a project in different branches it helps protect the master from potentially harmful changes.  Git also provides ways of tracking changes through commits. 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why use GitHub to store your code?
    </h3>
    <p>
        GitHub is great for storing code that multiple people will work on as a team.  It is also useful for people that may change which computer they are developing on periodically, by storing the information remotely.  GitHub takes the benefits of version control from git and allows the work to be saved remotely instead of locally.
