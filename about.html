			<h3 class="p-sm"> Where I am from</h3>
			<p class="p-sm">I was born in Chicago and lived there my entire life until recently.  I moved to San Francisco with my lovely girlfriend Sarah  two months ago.</p>

      <h3 class="p-sm">Interests </h3>
      <p class="p-sm">My morning routine is to check through about four or five music blogs or online magazines to read about new artists or to hear about what new albums all the critics are talking about.  I used to do a lot of driving for work and would listen to atleast one new album a day and by finding new music it helped keep my day intersting. </p>

      <h3 class="p-sm">Education and Experiences</h3>
      <p class="p-sm">I lived and went to school at the University of Illinois at Chicago for Civil Engineering.
      After graduating I worked for the Illinois Department of Transportation(IDOT). After a couple years working for IDOT as a resident engineer (A fancy way for saying a guy standing around witha clipboard). I got a job working with the engineering design firm Parsons Brinckerhoff where I worked until recently doing drainage design, sign planning, road design, environmental design - well I could go on with this list.  I pretty much did every type of engineering design that goes into roads.  I decided to make the change from road design to coding recently.  It's something I've always been interested in and really feel I can make an impact on the world in this avenue. </p>

      <h3 class="p-sm">Something quirky about you (This is a DBC tradition). </h3>
      <p class="p-sm">I'm really into competive gaming and e-sports.  It's something I have been very passionate about since I was a kid and I have followed it's growth to this day.  With my career change into coding, one of the first areas I want to have an impact on the world is to help e-sports grow by providing better sites and tools for people to learn about it and to watch it.</p>
