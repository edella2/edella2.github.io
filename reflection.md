### What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned so much about them and still feel like I don't understand them. There is so much to learn about padding borders and margin.  Alot of my issues are when I try to use padding or margin for a parent class and my layout for the children classes get messed up. 

### What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I was able to create a footer for my site, but I still don't understand why the "<html>" tag does not affect the entire site.  When I use chrome devtools, my footer is at the bottom of my html container, but the bottom of html container is not the bottom of what my screen displays.  I still have a lot to learn about CSS positioning.

### What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I found changing things like text color, font styles and back-ground colors very easy.  But anything with positioning was my nemesis.  I struggled a lot with trying to get things to sit right on my page.  And I even still have problems with things not lining up vertically correctly.  It was a pretty humbling experience.

### What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?


I learned about atomic CSS formatting from the video this week and even more about it from one of my pair partners.  I tried to take atomic CSS standards to heart and I think it actually has been one of the more helpful ways to learn what each of my CSS was doing to the html.
